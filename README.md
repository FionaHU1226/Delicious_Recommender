# Delicious_Recommender
## Introduction
This project is a recommendation system for the Delicious dataset. The dataset contains 1.9 million users, 2.8 million tags, and 100,000 items. The dataset is available at https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/. The recommendation system is based on collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. The system uses the user-item matrix and item-item matrix to make recommendations. The system also uses the tags associated with the items to make recommendations. The system uses the cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between items and tags. The system uses the user-item matrix to calculate the similarity between users and items. The system uses the item-item matrix to calculate the similarity between items. The system uses the tags associated with the items to calculate the similarity between items and tags.
