## 🌟 Inspiration

Cooking at home can be both fun and challenging, especially when trying to decide what to make with the ingredients available. I was inspired to create **Delicious Recommender** to simplify meal planning, reduce food waste, and inspire culinary creativity by providing personalized recipe suggestions based on the ingredients users have on hand.

## 🛠️ What It Does

**Delicious Recommender** allows users to input their available kitchen ingredients and select their preferred cuisine. The app then generates tailored recipe recommendations that match the provided ingredients and cuisine preferences. Users can explore multiple recipes, learn how to make them through integrated search links, and load more options to discover a variety of delicious dishes.

## 🏗️ How I Built It

I built **Delicious Recommender** using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the frontend interface, leveraging its simplicity and interactivity to create a seamless user experience. The recipe data is stored in a structured database (`recipe_database.py`), which the app accesses to filter and recommend recipes based on user inputs. Additionally, I integrated URL encoding with `urllib.parse` to generate dynamic search links for each recipe. While the current version utilizes basic filtering algorithms, future enhancements will incorporate AI-powered recommendations using the OpenAI API to provide more intelligent and personalized suggestions.
